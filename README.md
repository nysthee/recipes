[Original recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/rubys-barbecue-sauce-recipe.html)

### Ingredients

* 6 tablespoons soybean oil
* 1 medium red onion, diced
* 4 jalapeno peppers, diced (keep the seeds for 2 of them)
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 1 tablespoon dry mustard powder
* 1/2 tablespoon black pepper
* 1/2 tablespoon cayenne pepper
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt
* 100g brown sugar
* 18cl cup cider vinegar
* 1 bottle 500ml Heinz tomato ketchup
* 150g cup molasses
* 13 cl Worcestershire sauce
* 12 cl water

### Directions

1. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add onions and jalapenos and cook over medium heat until onions are soft and transparent, about 5 minutes.
3. Add salt, dry mustard, black pepper, cayenne, and garlic salt. Stir to combine and then mix in the brown sugar.
4. Add the cider vinegar, ketchup, molasses, Worcestershire, and water and whisk all together until thoroughly combined.
5. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 2 hours, whisking every few minutes to prevent sauce from burning and sticking to bottom.

7. Put it back into the ketchup bottle (you should have a little bit of leftover)
